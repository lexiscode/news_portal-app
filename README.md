## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed.
- You need Node.js and npm to handle frontend dependencies. BUT, alternatively, I will highly recommend you download [laragon](https://laragon.org/download/index.html) web server - which has the following pre-installed (Apache 2.4, Nginx, MySQL 8, PHP 8, Redis, Memcached, Node.js 18, npm, git).

### Installation
1. Immediately after installing [laragon](https://laragon.org/download/index.html) web server for the first time, you will need to reboot your computer afterwards.
2. Now into your computer's root directory (e.g. C:), enter these path `C:/laragon/`. Then double-click on the laragon application icon to open it.
3. Now ensure that you have no other web server running (e.g. XAMMP or any other), then inside the Laragon application click on  `StartAll`. Do not stop the server.
4. Then enter into this path directory `C:/laragon/www`, now run this command in order to install Laravel globally `composer global require laravel/installer` 
5. Now git clone this repository still inside this path directory (`C:/laragon/www`): `git clone https://github.com/lexiscode/news_portal-app.git`
6. Next, still in that Laragon application, click on `Database` button (another GUI displays), ensure the Network Type is: `MariaDB or MySQL (TCP/IP)`, if so then click on the `Open` button below the GUI to access the database interface.
7. Now at the top-left corner of the application, you should see `Laragon.MySQL` database section; right-click on it, then select `Create new`, then click on `Database`. Please ensure you name the database `news_portal`, then click OK.
8. Next, open the project directory (`C:/laragon/www/news_portal-app`) with any IDE (e.g. VS Code) and locate a file named `.env.example`, rename the file to `.env` only. 
9. Then inside that same .env file, find and renamed the value of the DB_DATABASE from `DB_DATABASE=news_portal` to `DB_DATABASE=news_portal`
10. Then still inside the project directory (that is, `C:/laragon/www/news_portal-app`) run this command: `composer install`
11. Lastly, run this migration command, still from within the project directory: `php artisan migrate`
12. Next, generate your own APP_KEY by running this command still from within the project directory: `php artisan key:generate`
13. Congratulations!!! Now read its Usage documentation below.


## Usage

To use the Personal Task Manager Application, follow these steps:
